#  MiniLibC

## Overview

This project aims to create a dynamic ELF library to replace, to a certain extent, the standard C library that is commonly used in systems. Through the bootstrap, it is now possible to replace some functions with our own implementations via a dynamic library, a process known as weak binding.
